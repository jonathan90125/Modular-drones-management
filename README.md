# Swarm Drones Management

This is the repo for controlling several drones using UDP protocol. The drones I use is DJI Tello(https://store.dji.com/product/tello?vid=38421&set_region=US&from=store-nav). The drones can be accessed by the host computers when they are all connected  to the same router. Through the local IP address, host computer can send separate command to each drone with the help of socket communication. The format of data is defined by DJI. A simple GUI for sending command to all the drones is also written.
